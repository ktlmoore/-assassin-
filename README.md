"Assassin" - not the game I meant to make

The files provided here have no guarantee of working and I don't really care what you do with them.

Find latest release of Assassin at http://www.tlear.co.uk/?p=81/

In order to compile Assassin, I recommend using Eclipse (or some other Java IDE).  You will need to install Gradle.  http://www.gradle.org/tooling.

Once you have Gradle installed, import a Gradle project from the folder assassin and select all of assassin, assassin-core and assassin-desktop.

If you have any problems, contact me.
